# Working-OoB-Linux-Wifi  
I'm testing if usb wifi dongles work out of the box on Linux.  
  
I want to make a list of usb wifi dongle that work out of the box on Linux to help people to buy the right one for your Linux.  
I try to test them on the most popular Linux distro.  
And try to give an alternative driver if i'ts not working proprely OoB.
