# Working-OoB-Linux-Wifi  
I'm testing if usb wifi dongles & PCI cards work out of the box on Linux.  
  
I want to make a list of usb wifi dongle that work out of the box on Linux to help people to buy the right one for your Linux.  
I try to test them on the most popular Linux distro.  
Eventually give an link to an solution/alternative driver if i'ts not working proprely OoB.  
  
### Testing yourself
You can help me to achieve this by testing your Wifi adaptaters and send me the results.  

### Donation
You can also send me your old Wifi adaptaters if you don't need them anymore. Please contact me.
